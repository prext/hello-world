# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
Hey everyone, my name is Preet and I'm a senior majoring in Information Technology and specializing in cybersecurity and a little bit of web development. In my free time, I'm either with friends or working out at the gym. But I'm excited to discover new things from digital crime that I might be able to use to protect myself and others. I also freelance for clients to make their websites using WIX, WordPress, Webflow, or Framer. Hope everyone has a nice semester and wishing y'all the best!
